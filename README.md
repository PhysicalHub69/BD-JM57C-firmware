Samsung BD-JM57C Firmware Dump

This repo contains the raw firmware dump for the Samsung BD-JM57C Blu-ray player.
Files Included:

    main-firmware.bin — The actual raw binary firmware. Identical in content to main-firmware.txt, just with the correct .bin extension to show it’s machine code, not text.

    main-firmware.txt — The same raw binary data, but saved with a .txt extension. If you open this in a text editor, you’ll see a mess of weird symbols because it’s not meant to be read as text.

Why both?

Providing both files for convenience — whether you want to use it as a proper binary dump or accidentally open it in a text editor and freak out at the “vomit” of characters.
Purpose:

    For analysis, reverse engineering, or modding the firmware of the BD-JM57C

    To hunt region locks, discover hidden configs, or patch features
